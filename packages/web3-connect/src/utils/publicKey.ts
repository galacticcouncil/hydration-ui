/**
 * Canonical dedup / savedBy key for an address across every supported chain.
 *
 * - H160 (EVM) -> the address itself
 * - SS58 (Substrate) -> the decoded public key
 * - Solana -> the address itself
 * - Sui -> the address itself
 * - anything else -> "" (falsy)
 *
 * Keys are stored case-preserved (base58 chains like Solana/Zcash are
 * case-sensitive). Always compare two keys with `stringEquals` (case-insensitive
 * by default) — never `===` — so EVM checksum-case variants still match.
 *
 * Branching mirrors getWalletModeByAddress so the key is consistent with the
 * chainKey classification used elsewhere.
